This repo is just me keeping track of what I have done learning Go and reminding me what I intend to do

 - [x] Simple web server (helloserver.go)

    - [x] Api that returns something in JSON (apiserver.go)
    - [x] Add logs (Logrus and seq hooks)
    - [x] Add test (apiserver_test.go)
 - [x] Request logger + log endpoint
    - [x] Simple middleware
    - [x] Capture all calls to all endpoints in "list" (Request recorder holds all requests)
    - [x] Add endpoint to return "list" of all calls (logs endpoint added)
